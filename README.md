# Battery Tray Icon

Battery Tray Icon is a windows tray icon app made with python. It checks the battery periodically and when it detects a change it will log that change which you can view as a graph later. 

## Installation

To install you can either clone this repo and import the nececasrry python libraries or you can click dowload as zip in the green code button and extact to do the same thing or you can go and dowload the zip from the releases tab.

## Roadmap

This is pretty much a finished app in my mind because I myself have been using it for the last 1-2 years and I don't think I have ever seen it misbehave so it is very stable ant it does the job.
